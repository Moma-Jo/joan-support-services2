    <h2>Dementia Care at Home: Supporting Your Loved One with Heart</h2>
    <p>Caring for someone with dementia is not just about tasks ‚Äî it‚Äôs about compassion, patience, and understanding. As someone who has worked with many individuals and families affected by dementia, I know how heartbreaking and challenging this journey can be. Dementia touches every part of life, not just for the person living with it, but for their loved ones as well.</p>

    <p>Every person experiences dementia differently, but with the right approach, we can slow the progression, ease confusion, and help your loved one live with dignity and joy ‚Äî right at home.</p>

    <h3>How to Support Someone with Dementia at Home</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Keep routines stable and familiar.</li>
      <li><strong>Gentle reminders:</strong> Use calendars, notes, and friendly cues.</li>
      <li><strong>Compassion:</strong> Meet confusion with kindness, not correction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Memory-Boosting Activities</h3>
    <p>Engaging the brain can help slow cognitive decline and bring meaningful connection. Here are a few gentle and enjoyable activities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple puzzles or memory games</li>
      <li>Looking through photo albums together</li>
      <li>Listening to music from their past</li>
      <li>Storytelling and reminiscence conversations</li>
      <li>Matching or sorting objects by colour or category</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These may seem simple, but when done with love and patience, they can spark joy and help a person feel grounded and valued.</p>

    <h3>You're Not Alone</h3>
    <p>If you‚Äôre caring for a loved one with dementia, please know that support is available ‚Äî and you don‚Äôt have to carry it all by yourself. Whether you need part-time relief, regular visits, or just someone to talk to, I‚Äôm here to walk this road with you. Together, we can make home a safe, peaceful, and loving place for your loved one.</p>
