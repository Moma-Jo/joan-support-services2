      <h2>Understanding Dementia</h2>
      <p>Dementia is not a single disease but a general term for the impaired ability to remember, think, or make decisions that interfere with everyday activities. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia. While there is currently no cure, certain activities and routines can help slow progression and improve quality of life.</p>

      <h2>How In-Home Care Helps</h2>
      <p>In-home care allows seniors to remain in familiar surroundings, reducing confusion and agitation. Personalized support from caregivers can ensure safety, comfort, and emotional well-being without the need to move into a facility.</p>
