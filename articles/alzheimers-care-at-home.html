    <h2>Alzheimer’s Care at Home: Gentle Support for Every Step of the Journey</h2>
    <p>Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s is deeply personal. This condition changes how your loved one thinks, remembers, and interacts — and it can feel overwhelming to navigate these changes alone. Having worked closely with individuals and families affected by Alzheimer’s, I’ve seen how the right support can make a world of difference.</p>

    <p>Alzheimer’s progresses gradually, often in stages. But no matter where your loved one is on that journey, it’s possible to provide comfort, safety, and connection right at home — with patience, compassion, and understanding.</p>

    <h3>What Helps Most with Alzheimer’s at Home</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Routine & Repetition:</strong> Predictable schedules reduce confusion and anxiety.</li>
      <li><strong>Familiar surroundings:</strong> Home is full of comforting memories — a powerful anchor for someone with Alzheimer’s.</li>
      <li><strong>Simple, clear communication:</strong> Short phrases, calm tone, and visual cues go a long way.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety awareness:</strong> Wandering and forgetfulness are common, so extra care with locks, stoves, and medications is key.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Meaningful Activities for Alzheimer’s Care</h3>
    <p>Staying engaged — even in small ways — can lift spirits and support memory. Some calming and helpful activities include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sorting laundry or folding towels</li>
      <li>Listening to familiar music or hymns</li>
      <li>Hand massages or light touch therapy</li>
      <li>Watching family videos or photo slideshows</li>
      <li>Watering plants or tending to simple garden tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These activities aren’t just “busy work.” They give purpose, ease anxiety, and help your loved one feel involved and respected.</p>

    <h3>You're Not Alone</h3>
    <p>Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s is both a gift and a challenge. If you're feeling stretched, unsure, or in need of a break — you are not alone. I offer kind, respectful in-home support so your loved one can stay safe and cared for, and you can rest and recharge.</p>

    <p>Whether you need a few hours of relief or regular, ongoing help, I’m here. Let’s work together to bring peace, comfort, and dignity to your loved one’s daily life — at home.</p>
