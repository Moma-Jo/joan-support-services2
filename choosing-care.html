    <h2>How to Choose In-Home Senior Care in Stittsville</h2>
    <p>When a loved one begins to need more support at home, choosing the right care can feel overwhelming. In Stittsville and surrounding areas like Kanata, many families are now choosing <strong>in-home personal support</strong> over traditional retirement homes.</p>
    <p>In-home care allows seniors to stay in the comfort of their own homes while receiving the help they need ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs light housekeeping, companionship, meal prep, or personal care.</p>
    <p>As a <strong>Personal Support Worker (PSW)</strong> with years of experience, I offer one-on-one, compassionate care tailored to each client‚Äôs needs. My goal is to make every visit feel like a trusted helping hand ‚Äî not a service, but a relationship.</p>
    <p>Whether you need a few hours a week or occasional respite, I‚Äôm here to support both seniors and their families with respect, consistency, and kindness.</p>
    <p><strong>If you're looking for trusted in-home senior care in Stittsville or Kanata</strong>, feel free to <a href="mailto:vizyoung10@gmail.com">get in touch</a>. Let‚Äôs talk about what support could look like for your family.</p>
